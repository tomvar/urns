6;payment;1;57;;1;;0;0;0;798;180;200;220;I started with Urn A and if I was earing money, I continued picking A. If I was loosing money in A, that ment that the probability of loosing was inceasing, so I moved to und B and chose it consistently until the end.;A;strategy;Max_profit

6;payment;1;52;;1;;0;0;0;1125;200;200;230;I was choosing urn A for most of the times. I had possibility of doubling red balls everytime the result was red, which means the probability for red ball was increasing.

6;payment;1;26;;1;;0;0;0;894;130;150;140;At the beginning of the game I wanted to take a couple balls from the red urn because at the beginning the probability of getting the profit was 50%. If after 3 or 4 turnes the probability turned in favour ( for example  57/60 %) I will continue to draw the balls from this urn until the probability drops below 50. As soon as the probability of drawing the winning ball from this urn was more than two draws below 50% I abondon this urn completely and only choose balls from the other urn;A;strategy;Min_risk

6;payment;1;58;;1;;0;0;0;1182;200;200;250;I started from drawing one ball from urn A. If in 1. rund I drew red ball and I earned 30K, then in next rund I also drew a ball from urn A, as long as number of red balls in urn one was bigger than number of black balls. If number of balck balls was bigger then red balls in urn A, I switched to urn B to minimize the risk;A;strategy;Max_profit

6;payment;1;23;;1;;0;0;0;1359;300;240;320;I first used Urn A to take advantage of its compounding power, then Urn B to stabilize results in subsequent rounds or when Urn A's risk got too high.;A;strategy;Max_profit

6;payment;1;44;;1;;0;0;0;1068;200;240;220;Urn B is lower risk, so I began the game by choosing Urn B. After three rounds and earning 21K, I switched to Urn A and continued to choose it until I experienced a loss. Then I returned to Urn B and repeated the same strategy.;A;strategy;Min_risk
